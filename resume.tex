\begin{rSection}{Projects}


{\bf Deployment and Orchestration of a Kubernetes Infrastructure}\hfill{\textbf{Ithaca, NY, USA}}
\\{\em Individual Project}\hfill {\em Jan. 2023 -- Present}
\\ $ \bullet $Engineered a scalable Kubernetes infrastructure with \textbf{Kubeadm} and Helm, efficiently managing high-traffic web services.
\\ $ \bullet $Orchestrated \textbf{Docker} containers using \textbf{Kubernetes} for effective load balancing and auto-scaling.
\\ $ \bullet $Deployed \textbf{Nginx Ingress} to manage external service access, enhancing security and load distribution.
\\ $ \bullet $Utilized \textbf{Prometheus} and Grafana to monitor system performance and health, optimizing resource utilization and stability.
\\ $ \bullet $Established a centralized logging infrastructure using \textbf{Elasticsearch}, Logstash, Kibana (\textbf{ELK} Stack), and \textbf{Kafka}, thereby facilitating real-time log processing, comprehensive system monitoring, and efficient troubleshooting.
\\ $ \bullet $Integrated DroneCI and Github for \textbf{CI/CD}, enabling streamlined updates and efficient bug fixes.



{\bf Full-Stack Development and Management of High-Traffic Web Services}\hfill{\textbf{Ithaca, NY, USA}}
\\{\em Individual Project}\hfill {\em April 2018 -- Present}
\\ $ \bullet $Conceptualized, designed, and deployed various self-developed, purpose-specific websites and web services.
\\ $ \bullet $Utilized cutting-edge technologies like Gatsby, \textbf{ReactJS}, \textbf{Sass}, Bootstrap, WebSocket, and \textbf{JQuery} for building interactive and responsive front-ends for websites, using GA4 for data-driven performance tracking and user interaction analysis.
\\ $ \bullet $Efficiently handled back-end services using a mix of Node.js, \textbf{Express}, Python \textbf{Flask}, and \textbf{PHP}, showing flexibility and adaptability across different programming environments and requirements.
\\ $ \bullet $Created a highly popular public Random Image API using \textbf{PHP}, \textbf{MySQL}, and Redis, which has \textbf{over 100,000 visits} per day, demonstrating the ability to develop and manage high-performance web services.

{\bf Distributed, Linearizable, Sharded Key-Value Database}\hfill{\textbf{Ithaca, NY, USA}}
\\{\em Course Project advised by Prof. Lorenzo Alvisi}\hfill {\em March 2023 -- May 2023}
\\ $ \bullet $Designed and built a robust, sharded key-value store in \textbf{Java}, optimized for performance in distributed settings.
\\ $ \bullet $Implemented and modified the \textbf{Multi-Paxos} protocol, a crucial algorithm to guarantee the database system's resilience and continued operation, given a majority of servers remain functional.
\\ $ \bullet $Enhanced the system's functionality by streamlining the Multi-Paxos protocol into a simpler, more efficient \textbf{Raft}-like protocol, resulting in improved system performance and reduced complexity.
\\ $ \bullet $Employed a strategic approach to optimize the key-value store by incorporating sharding across server groups. Each group was designed to execute the Paxos consensus algorithm, thus ensuring system-wide consistency and reliability.
